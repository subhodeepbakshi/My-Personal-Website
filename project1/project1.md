# Project 1: Tracking Movement of Quadcopter using Model Predictive Controller

**Duration:** August 2022 â€“ December 2022

## Project Description

In this project, I worked on tracking the movement of a quadcopter using a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The goal was to design a controller that could effectively control the quadcopter's position and orientation, allowing it to follow a desired trajectory.

## Project Highlights

- **Modeling and Simulation:** I started by modeling and simulating a simplified linearized quadcopter model. To accomplish this, I used the Simulink Control Design toolbox in MATLAB. This step was crucial in understanding the dynamics of the quadcopter.

- **Control Parameter Identification:** After obtaining the quadcopter model, I identified the control input parameters. This process involved analyzing the system's behavior and determining how the controller should manipulate the quadcopter's inputs to achieve the desired trajectory.

- **Optimization:** To improve the performance of the MPC controller, I utilized a finite-time horizon approach. This involved optimizing weight penalties to fine
